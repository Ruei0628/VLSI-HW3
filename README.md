Implement three designs using Verilog:
1. A 14-bit square root carry select adder.
2. A 16-bit Brent-Kung tree adder.
3. A 9-bit-by-7-bit Wallace tree multiplier that utilizes the Brent-Kung tree adder (described above) as its final-stage CLA.

Note: A testbench is provided overall, and the testbench for design (3) is integrated within the module itself.
